        <p>The massive ruined site of the ancient city of Pompeii is among the top attractions in Italy and one of the best preserved ancient cities in the world, due to it being buried by volcanic ash from nearby Mount Vesuvius nearly 2,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>The gateway city to Pompeii is the major city of Naples, with its Central Station about 40 minutes away from Pompeii via train. Due to its ease of access, Pompeii is an extremely popular day-trip from Rome, Naples, and even the nearby Amalfi Coast.</p>
        <h3>Herculaneum &amp; Vesuvius</h3>
        <!-- Read More Read Less Tab -->
        <div class="hidden-content">
            <p>In addition to Pompeii, several other ancient Roman sites are located along the scenic Bay of Naples, including the Villa Oplontis inhabited by Emperor Nero’s wife located very close to Pompeii, and the major site of the ancient city of Herculaneum. All of these sites were buried underneath volcanic ash from the eruption of nearby Mount Vesuvius, which still towers above the landscape today. Because of the volcanic ash, many of these ancient sites have been incredibly well-preserved and are now UNESCO world heritage sites.</p>

        <h2 class="left-heading destination-section-heading">Pompeii Archaeological Site</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Pompeii Archaeological Site</strong> sprawls across a large area, hosting the remains of thousands of structures with various levels of preservation. Pompeii was a significant city in Ancient Rome until it was swiftly destroyed and buried deep in volcanic ash by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE.</p>
        <p>Because of its preservation under the ash, Pompeii provides an incredible and unique snapshot into ancient Roman life in a 2,000 year-old city. It’s recommended to purchase your tickets to Pompeii in advance in order to avoid waiting in long lines.</p>
        <p>Many of the ancient structures and rooms of Pompeii are available for tourists to freely explore on their own. A grid-system of ancient roads exists throughout the city, surrounding the densely-packed buildings.</p>
        <p>Due to its massive size and the high levels of detail seen in many of the structures, you might need more than a single day if you want to thoroughly explore these ruins. You should also consider doing a guided tour for Pompeii, as there isn’t much historical context provided around the archaeological site.</p>
        <h3>Pompeii Forum</h3>
        <p>Pompeii’s most iconic attraction is the <strong>Pompeii Forum</strong>, the expansive public square which hosts large sculptures and is surrounded by columns and ancient temples, such as the Sanctuary of Apollo and the Temple of Giove. Behind the Temple of Giove are the stunning Forum Baths with much of its intricately carved ceilings and many statues and frescoes still intact. This is just one of many bath complexes located at Pompeii.</p>
        <p>Just south of the Forum are the Basilica Scavi with its giant statues of men and an angel, and the <strong>Temple of Venus</strong> which provides breathtaking views overlooking the mountains of the Sorrentine Peninsula.</p>
        <h3>Villas and Houses</h3>
        <p>Pompeii also hosts countless houses, many of which were villas owned by the elite, which were lavishly decorated with intricate frescoes and mosaics, and constructed with features like enclosed gardens, swimming pools, fountains, and lavish columns. There are many of these houses around Pompeii worth seeing, with some of the most notable being the House of the Vetti, House of the Tragic Poet, and <strong>House of Merander</strong>, amongst many others.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most incredible sight at Pompeii is the <strong>Villa of the Mysteries</strong> located at the very northern end of Pompeii, which has been stunningly well-preserved. This villa hosts countless colorful frescoes and murals with rich details. Additionally, the Villa of the Mysteries is huge with many rooms.</p>
        <h3>Amphitheater and More</h3>
        <p>Additional amazing attractions at Pompeii include the strikingly well-preserved <strong>Teatro Grande</strong> (Great Theatre), the smaller Teatro Piccolo theatre, and the highly photogenic <strong>Quadriportico</strong>, a giant courtyard surrounded by columns (once supporting a colonnade) located adjacent to the two theaters. Also very impressive is the giant <strong>Amphitheater of Pompeii</strong>, which hosts gladiatorial fights that could be watched by up to 20,000 spectators.</p>
        <p>Other must-see attractions amongst the ruins of Pompeii include the Stabiane bath complex, the lush vineyards and striking ruins of the Garden of the Fugitives, and the Lupanare, a stunningly well-preserved two-story Roman brothel house.</p>
        <h3>Museum and Artifacts</h3>
        <p>Be sure to also visit the Antiquarium Museum of Pompeii, which hosts illustrations and 3D models of what the structures of Pompeii would have looked like before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. This museum helps fill the gap when looking at the ruins to help you visualize what the site looked like in its heyday. The museum also hosts educational films about Pompeii.</p>
        <p>If you’re looking to see the incredible artifacts from Pompeii, some of them are hosted around the archaeological site, however many of them are on display at the Naples National Archaeological Museum.</p>

    <!-- Reaching Pompeii Dropdown -->
    <section class="destination-section">
        <h2 class="left-heading destination-section-heading">Reaching Pompeii</h2>
        <p>The fastest way to reach Pompeii from Naples is via a 30 minute bus ride, which stops next to Naples Central Train Station and drops off right in front of the entrance to Pompeii. By train it’s about a 30 minute ride from Naples to Pompeii’s trainstation, followed by a 10 minute walk to Pompeii’s eastern, less busy entrance.</p>
        <p>You can also reach Pompeii’s train station directly from the Amalfi Coast’s most eastern town, Vietri sul Mare (near Salerno) in about 40 minutes, followed by the similar 10 minute walk to the eastern entrance.</p>
        <p>From the city of Sorrento, it’s a 30 minute train ride to Pompeii’s western station, which is located adjacent to Pompeii’s western main entrance.</p>
        <p>From Rome’s Roma Termini station in the city’s historic center you can reach the western or eastern entrance of Pompeii in about 2-2.5 hours, with a change-over in Naples to either a train or bus (both located at or next to Naples Central Station).</p>

        <p>Located in there suburb of Torre Annunziata just two train stops before Pompeii is the Villa Poppaea, also known as <strong>Villa Oplontis</strong>. This villa likely belonged to the second wife of the infamous Emperor Nero.</p>
        <p>Villa Oplontis is quite large with many rooms, hosting many beautiful frescoes and marble columns. Even the villa’s swimming pool has survived, although today it is filled with a field of grass. Artifacts found at the villa can be seen at the Naples National Archaeological Museum.</p>

        <p>The infamous <strong>Mount Vesuvius</strong> is a massive volcano located near Naples, very close to the ancient ruins of Pompeii. Mount Vesuvius is actually still an active volcano which has had several minor eruptions in modern history, however its most famous eruption was in 79 CE when it destroyed / buried the nearby ancient Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum.</p>
        <p>The peak of Mount Vesuvius is about 4,200 feet (1,280 m) in elevation, towering over the nearby cities along the Bay of Naples. Vesuvius is a popular hiking spot near Naples, since you can enjoy breathtaking panoramic views overlooking the Bay of Naples and the nearby Sorrentine Peninsula from atop Vesuvius. You can reach the trailhead near the top of Vesuvius via bus or taxi and hike around a section of the volcano’s caldera.</p>

        <h2 class="left-heading destination-section-heading">Herculaneum Archaeological Site</h2>
        <p>A little less than halfway between Naples and Pompeii (closer to Naples) is the <strong>Archaeological Park of Herculaneum</strong> (or Ercolano), which is a rather compact site but densely packed with many structures. These densely packed buildings are mostly luxury homes of the Roman elite, as Herculaneum was a particularly wealthy city, and popular due to its proximity to the ocean.</p>
        <p>Due to the large number of elite residents in the city, many of the homes at Herculaneum display lavish building materials such as colored marble, as well as highly intricate mosaics. Some of the houses also host beautiful frescoes and sculptures, and unlike Pompeii, certain elements such as wooden doors have been preserved at Herculaneum.</p>
        <p>The site also hosts a ruined bath house and tight streets that you can wander around and explore. If you’d like to see the many artifacts found at Herculaneum, they are on display at the Naples National Archaeological Museum.</p>
        <p>To reach Herculaneum by train from Naples you’ll need to ride the train from the Central Station to the Portici-Ercolano Station for about 20 minutes, and then take a short bus ride or walk about 20 minutes to reach the entrance to the site.</p>
