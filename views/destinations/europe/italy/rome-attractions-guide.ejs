    <!-- Introduction to Rome Dropdown -->
    <section class="destination-section">
        <h2 class="left-heading destination-introduction-heading">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Italy's capital city of Rome is also known as the eternal city, as it contains many well-preserved ancient structures and attractions with people living their modern daily lives amongst the ruins. You’ll fine most of Rome’s countless attractions and sights huddled around the city’s historic ancient center, including the sovereign micro-country of Vatican City, located on the western side of the Tiber River which flows through the middle of Rome.</p>
        <p>Many tourists are unaware that Rome is located quite close to the sandy beaches of the Mediterranean Sea, which are less than 15 miles (22 km) from the center of Rome.</p>
        <h3>Pre-Booking Popular Attractions</h3>
        <p>It's highly recommended to purchase a Roma Pass when visiting the city, which includes entrance to the city's most popular sights including Vatican, the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and one more sight of your choice, along with free city transportation for a low price.</p>
        <p>If you choose not to get the pass, be sure to pre-book your reservations to these incredibly popular sights at least several days in advance, otherwise you may not be able to see them (note that with the pass you still must pre-book).</p>

        <h2 class="left-heading destination-section-heading">Roman Colosseum</h2>
        <p>Rome’s most iconic attraction is of course the <strong>Roman Colosseum,</strong> an exceptionally well-preserved multi-story amphitheater built in the 1st century CE. In addition to gladiator fights and performances, this amazing structure was even above to have its arena temporarily flooded, in order to host naval battle reenactments with full-scale ships.</p>
        <p>Be sure to visit the Colosseum both in the day, and at night when it lights up. In order to visit inside the Colosseum, you’ll need to pre-book your visit several days in advance, due to its extreme popularity. In order to tour the labyrinth of rooms and underground chambers beneath the Colosseum, you’ll need to book a special tour.</p>
        <p>In front of the Roman Colosseum you can admire the intricate <strong>Arch of Constantine</strong>, an ancient triumphal arch.</p>
        <h3>Domus Aurea</h3>
        <p>Just north of the Roman Colosseum are the ruins of ancient Roman Emperor Nero’s Domus Aurea palace. In an attempt to erase the legacy of Nero, the Domus Aurea was stripped of its more expensive building materials and filled with dirt. After filling the palace, the Romans built the Baths of Trajan atop the palace, whose remains can still be seen above ground. Because of this, the remains of the palace have been well-preserved, and you can take an amazing tour through the Domus Area which incorporates virtual reality.</p>

    <section class="destination-section">
        <h2 class="left-heading destination-section-heading">Roman Forum</h2>
        <p>Adjacent to the Roman Colosseum and the Arch of Constantine you’ll find the entrance to the ancient <strong>Roman Forum</strong> complex. This vast complex hosts countless temples, buildings, and other structures that you could spend hours exploring. In order to access the Forum however, you’ll need to pre-book your visit several days in advance.</p>
        <p>Among the top sight in the Roman Forum are the ruins of the 4th century Basilica of Maxentius, the statues and pools of the House of Vestals, the towering columns of the Temple of Saturn, and the Arch of Titus at the entrance to the Forum.</p>
        <h3>Palatine Hill</h3>
        <p>On the southern side of the Forum is the <strong>Palatine Hill</strong> complex, hosting the Flavian Palace of Domitian, the Houses of Emperors Augustus and Tiberius, the Palatine Stadium, a bath complex, and the Palatine Museum hosting artifacts found at the site.</p>
        <h3>Night Tour</h3>
        <p>While exploring the Forum on your own is an amazing experience, you might also consider taking a guided tour in order to gain better context of the many incredible structures at the Forum. There’s also the possibility of taking guided tours of the Roman Forum at night when many of the ruins are illuminated and no other tourists are allowed inside the Forum.</p>
        <h3>Circus Maximus</h3>
        <p>On the southwestern side of the Roman Forum, just outside the walls of the Palatine Hill is the vast open field of <strong>Circus Maximus</strong>, which you can visit for free. Circus Maximus was the site of ancient Roman chariot races, and you can still see the shape of the ancient arena in the ground. At the eastern end of the Circus Maximus are a significant amount of ancient ruins and structures.</p>

    <section class="destination-section">
        <a class="anchor" id="capitoline-hill"></a>
        <h2 class="left-heading destination-section-heading">Capitoline Hill</h2>
        <h3>Campidoglio Plaza</h3>
        <p>Separate from the Roman Forum overlooking the site from the western side is Capitoline Hill (or the Capitolium). The Capitoline Hill consists of several stunning Renaissance-era buildings and palaces around the <strong>Campidoglio</strong> plaza, designed by the great Michelangelo. A grand staircase lined with sculptures leads up to this stunning plaza. Behind the Campidoglio you can enjoy exceptional views overlooking the Roman Forum.</p>
        <h3>Capitoline Museums</h3>
        <p>The buildings and palaces around Campidoglio are all connected to each other and make up the <strong>Capitoline Museums</strong> complex. Interestingly, the Capitoline Museums hold the title of the first public museum in the world, founded in 1734.</p>
        <p>Within these beautiful Renaissance palace buildings you’ll find an incredible collection of ancient Roman artifacts and sculptures, including the famous Capitoline Wolf, set amongst lavish interiors. The Capitoline Museums also hosts fine art from the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the Capitoline Coin Cabinet, and Ancient Greek and Egyptian sculptures.</p>
        <h3>Basilica of Santa Maria in Are Coeli</h3>
        <p>Adjacent to Campidoglio Square is the extravagant 12th century <strong>Basilica of Santa Maria in Are Coeli</strong>. A long staircase leads up to the rather plain facade of this basilica, but inside you’ll find incredibly elaborate ceiling and many fresco masterpieces by Pinturicchio.</p>
        <h3>Victor Emmanuel II National Monument (Altar&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Fatherland)</h3>
        <p>Next to Campidoglio Square and the Roman Forum is the breathtaking <strong>Victor Emmanuel II National Monument</strong> with its picturesque colonnade, and the monumental Altar of the Fatherland at its center. This incredible modern structure was created to resemble what a grandiose ancient Roman forum would have looked like during its heyday with a neoclassical twist. Many elegant statues adorn the terraces and staircases of this highly photogenic monument.</p>
        <p>Within the monument you’ll find museums with exhibits on Italian Reunification, Italian history, and shifting temporary exhibitions. The Victor Emmanuel II National Monument is the centerpiece of Rome’s Piazza Venezia square.</p>
        <h3>Terrazza delle Quadrighe Terrace</h3>
        <p>Be sure to take the Ascensori Panoramici elevator or climb the stairs to the top of the Victor Emmanuel II Monument, which hosts the <strong>Terrazza delle Quadrighe</strong> terrace. From atop this terrace you can enjoy gorgeous panoramic view overlooking much of Ancient Rome, including the Roman Forum and Trajan Forum just below the monument, as well as the nearby Colosseum, and even stretching out to the massive St. Peter’s Basilica of Vatican City.</p>

    <!-- Trajan's Forum Dropdown -->
    <section class="destination-section">
        <a class="anchor" id="trajans-forum"></a>
        <h2 class="left-heading destination-section-heading">Trajan's Forum</h2>
        <p>Across the street from the Roman Forum ruins and the Victor Emmanuel II National Monument is another vast complex of ancient ruins, including the Trajan’s Forum, Trajan’s Market, Forum of Augustus, and more.</p>
        <p>The ruins of <strong>Trajan’s Forum</strong> are located below street level, surrounded by walkways and balconies for tourists to admire the ruins from. If you’d like to walk through the ruins, you’ll need to pre-book a guided tour, with the best tours taking place at night when the Trajan’s Forum is illuminated.</p>
        <h3>Trajan’s Column</h3>
        <p>Towering above Trajan’s Forum is the stunning <strong>Trajan’s Column</strong>, made of marble with intricate carvings covering it, depicting battle scenes from the Dacian Wars.</p>
        <h3>Trajan’s Market</h3>
        <p>Behind the Trajan’s Forum are the well-preserved ruins of <strong>Trajan’s Market</strong>, an ancient multi-story shopping mall. In addition to stores, the Trajan’s Market complex hosted apartments and administrative offices for Ancient Rome. This ancient structure was also modified by adding on taller multi-story buildings behind the Trajan’s Market during the Middle Ages.</p>
        <p>The Trajan’s Market today hosts a museum of ancient Roman artifacts gathered from various forums around Rome, displayed within the historic halls and rooms of this ancient structure. From the top of the Trajan’s Market you can enjoy amazing views overlooking the ruins of Trajan’s Forum and the Roman Forum.</p>
        <h3>Forums of Augustus and Nerva</h3>
        <p>At the southern end of the Trajan’s Forum are the ruins of the <strong>Forum of Augustus</strong>, which is best known for its photogenic columns of the ancient Temple of Mars. Just beyond this is are the ruins of the smaller Forum of Nerva. Both of these forums can also be viewed from the street level.</p>
        <h3>Le Domus Romane di Palazzo Valentini Museum</h3>
        <p>At the northern end of the Trajan’s Forum is the 16th century Palazzo Valentini palace, which hosts the Le Domus Romane Museum. Within this museum you can walk atop glass floors above ancient Roman ruins and view immersive multimedia exhibits to learn more about life in Ancient Rome.</p>

        <h2 class="left-heading destination-section-heading">Iconic Sights</h2>
        <h3>Trevi Fountain</h3>
        <p>One of Rome’s most iconic sights is the elegant <strong>Trevi Fountain</strong> with its stunning baroque architecture and sculptures, built in the 18th century. The Trevi Fountain is a majestic sight during the day, but even more beautiful at night when the vibrant light blue waters and sculptures are illuminated.</p>
        <h3>Pantheon</h3>
        <p>Within walking distance of the Trevi Fountain and Trajan’s Forum is the <strong>Pantheon</strong>, an architectural masterpiece known for its massive perfectly rounded dome with a giant hole (called an oculus) in the middle to allow light to shine through. Incredibly, the Pantheon is so well built that it has survived nearly 2,000 years of history.</p>
        <p>The Pantheon’s dome is such an amazing feat of engineering that to this day it remains the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world. The inside of the dome is carved with strikingly intricate checkerboard patterns, and the interior overall is a magnificent sight to behold.</p>
        <h3>Temple of Hadrian</h3>
        <p>Nearby the Pantheon you can admire the preserved facade of the ancient <strong>Temple of Hadrian</strong> with its massive columns. This single side of the temple’s exterior is all that remains of the original structure today.</p>
        <h3>Largo di Torre Argentina</h3>
        <p>Also in this area is the large archaeological site of <strong>Largo di Torre Argentina</strong> located below the modern city level, taking up an entire city block. You can walk around all four sides of this site to admire the many ancient ruins below, which also now serves as a home for many ferrel cats with an adoption center. Among the ruins at this site are several Roman temples and part of the Pompey’s Theatre, where Julius Caesar was assassinated.</p>

    <!-- Sant'Angelo Castle Dropdown -->
    <section class="destination-section">
        <h2 class="left-heading destination-section-heading">Sant'Angelo Castle</h2>
        <p>Just across the River Tiber from Central Rome is the exceptionally well-preserved <strong>Castel Sant’Angelo</strong> (Castle of the Holy Angel), originally built in the 2nd century CE. The most photogenic view of this castle can be seen both night and day from the <strong>Ponte Sant’Angelo Bridge</strong>, which leads directly to the castle’s entrance.</p>
        <p>The Castel Sant’Angelo has a very interesting history, originally built as a mausoleum for Emperor Hadrian. Later the castle was connected to the Vatican and and used as a fortress by popes, before later being used as a prison. Today the castle is an incredible museum with a rich history that you can explore.</p>
        <p>Inside the castle you’ll find many ancient corridors to explore, as well as extravagantly decorated Papal Apartments from the Renaissance era, medieval weaponry, a treasury, a military history museum, and more. The castle also hosts beautiful courtyards and balconies from which you can enjoy amazing views over Rome and the Vatican.</p>

        <h2 class="left-heading destination-section-heading">Piazzas &amp; Parks</h2>
        <h3>Piazza Navona</h3>
        <p>Rome’s most famous plaza is the expansive <strong>Piazza Navona</strong>, with its most famous feature being the elegant baroque-style Fiumi Fountain topped with intricate sculptures surrounding and towering obelisk. The plaza also hosts two additional marble fountains with ornate sculptures, and the entire Piazza Navona is surrounded by lovely historic structures, including the lavish baroque-style <strong>Church of Sant’Agnese in Agone</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Piazza di Spagna &amp; Spanish&nbsp;Steps</h3>
        <p>The Piazza di Spagna hosts Rome’s famous <strong>Spanish Steps</strong>, one of the city’s top attractions, with its beautiful steps and elegant terraces. This iconic baroque-style staircase sits behind the Barcaccia Fountain, leading up to the posh Trinita dei Monti Church, which towers above the steps. The Spanish Steps are one of Rome’s most photographed sights.</p>
        <h3>Piazza Repubblica</h3>
        <p>On the eastern side of Central Rome is the <strong>Piazza dellla Repubblica</strong> plaza, located next to the Rome’s main train station, Roma Termini. The Piazza della Repubblica is quite modern, built in the late 19th century, with grand rounded buildings built around a beautiful fountain. This plaza is especially charming at night when the fountain and buildings are illuminated.</p>
        <h3>Piazza del Popolo</h3>
        <p>At the northern end of Rome’s historic center is the grandiose <strong>Piazza del Popolo</strong>, a vast urban square surrounded by neoclassical buildings. At the center of the Piazza del Popolo is the towering Flaminio Obelisk, taken from Heliopolis in Ancient Egypt and brought to Rome by Caesar Augustus. Carved into this stunning ancient Egyptian obelisk are inscriptions and hieroglyphics.</p>
        <p>On the northern side of the Piazza del Popolo is the Porta del Popolo, a 15th century gate to the city built atop the original ancient Roman gate to the formal city. On the southern side of the plaza are two highly photogenic domed churches, appearing almost as side-by-side twins.</p>
        <h3>Terrazza del Pincio</h3>
        <p>For one of the best views in Rome, you can walk up the hill from the Piazza del Popolo to the <strong>Terrazza del Pincio</strong>, a hilltop terrace. From this terrace you can admire the incredible views overlooking the plaza and the rooftops of Rome, with the towering St. Peter’s Basilica of Vatican City in the background. The Terrazza del Pincio terrace is also one of the best spots for sunset in Rome, since the viewpoint faces directly towards the setting sun beside the St. Peter’s Basilica.</p>
        <h3>Villa Borghese Park</h3>
        <p>Behind the Piazza del Popolo and Terrazza del Pincio is the vast urban park of <strong>Villa Borghese</strong>, located in the hills above Rome. This massive park is extremely scenic to walk around and explore, as the Villa Borghese hosts many beautiful gardens, monuments, fountains, and even temples. Among the most famous sights in the Villa Borghese is the picturesque <strong>Temple of Asclepius</strong>, an Ancient Rome inspired monument surrounded by a lovely pond, built in the 18th century.</p>
        <p>The Villa Borghese park also hosts Rome’s Bioparco di Roma zoo, as well as several museums including the Galleria Borghese, the National Gallery of Modern Art, and the National Etruscan Museum. You can find more out more about these museums in Rome's Museums section.</p>

    <!-- Vatican City Dropdown -->
    <section class="destination-section">
        <a class="anchor" id="vatican-city"></a>
        <h2 class="left-heading destination-section-heading">Vatican City</h2>
        <p>On the western side of the Tiber River from Central Rome is the smallest country on Earth, Vatican City, which is so small that is fits entirely within the city of Rome. Nearly the entire country is surrounded by walls, and about half of the country is the Vatican Gardens, which can only be visited with a special small pre-booked tour.</p>
        <p>In order to visit Vatican City (other than St. Peter’s Square), you’ll need to pre-book tours, especially for the Vatican Museums (and Sistine Chapel), which can only be seen on a guided tour. These tours are booked based on time slots, as are visits to the St. Peter’s Basilica. Due to high demand, it’s highly recommended to book tours as far in advance as possible.</p>
        <h3>St. Peter’s Square</h3>
        <p>When you enter Vatican City you arrive at the vast <strong>St. Peter’s Square</strong>, a stunning sight lined with rounded colonnades and an ancient Egyptian obelisk at its center. Towering above Vatican Square is the massive St. Peter’s Basilica, a truly picturesque sight when viewed framed behind the square.</p>
        <p>It’s also possible to visit St. Peter’s Square when the Pope is there addressing the crowd, which occurs nearly every Wednesday morning. In order to be a part of this crowd, you’ll need to pre-book a free ticket.</p>
        <h3>St. Peter’s Basilica</h3>
        <p>Vatican City is home to the great Papal Basilica of Saint Peter, often referred to as <strong>Saint Peter’s Basilica</strong>, one of the four major basilicas of Roman Catholicism, and the largest church in the world. The original church at the site was built in the 4th century, however the current basilica is a grandiose 16th century marvel, built in Renaissance-style and designed by many great architects including Michelangelo. The basilica also hosts the tomb of St. Peter.</p>
        <p>Among St. Peter’s Basilica’s most impressive features is its massive dome (or cupola), much of which was designed by Michelangelo. The dome rises high above the skyline of Rome and can be admired from many part of the city.</p>
        <p>For the best views overlooking St. Peter’s Square, you’ll want to either take the stairs or elevator to the top of the basilica’s dome, from which you can enjoy the most beautiful view in Vatican City. Tickets to visit the dome are separate from gaining access to the basilica, and you can purchase these tickets ahead of time if you like.</p>
        <p>Inside the St. Peter’s Basilica are some of the most magnificent and opulent interiors you can imagine, much of it constructed of marble. The basilica’s interior hosts many stunningly intricate mosaics, as well as many ornate sculptures and furnishings, many of which were designed by Bernini and other famous Renaissance artists.</p>
        <h3>Vatican Museums</h3>
        <p>The vast <strong>Vatican Museums</strong> contain a rich collection of fine art, sculptures, artifacts, and treasures, however you can only visit the museums as part of a guided tour. The Vatican Museums host some of the most important ancient Roman and Greek sculptures in the world, such as the Augustus of Prima Porta statue. This statue along with many other incredible sculptures and mosaics in the Vatican Museums were found within ancient royal villas.</p>
        <p>Among the Vatican Museum’s fine art collection are older works by Leonardo da Vinci, Titian, Raphael, and more. The Vatican also hosts a significant modern art collection with works by artists such as Van Gogh, Picasso, and Dali. The Vatican Museums even host significant archaeological finds from ancient Egyptian and Etruscan civilizations. All of these amazing historical treasures are displayed amongst majestic, decadent interiors and halls.</p>
        <h3>Sistine Chapel</h3>
        <p>At the end of the tour through the Vatican Museums you get to see the famous Sistine Chapel, with its incredible fresco ceilings painstakingly painted by Michelangelo. The most iconic fresco in Sistine Chapel is The Creation of Adam, featuring God’s finer reaching out towards Adam’s hand. This is just one of the many highly elaborate frescoes you can admire within the Sistine Chapel.</p>

        <h3>Borghese Gallery</h3>
        <p>The most famous museum at Villa Borghese is the Borghese Gallery and Museum (or Galleria Borghese), housed within an extravagant former villa. The Galleria Borghese’s collections include historic fine art, sculptures, ancient mosaics, frescoes, and more. Among the museum’s most famous pieces are the sculptures by Bernini.</p>      
        <p>Due to its extremely popularity and small size, you’ll need to pre-book tickets for this museum several weeks in advance.
        <h3>Other Museums</h3>
        <p>Another popular museum within the Villa Borghese park is the Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Moderna e Contemporanea (National Gallery of Modern and Contemporary Art). As its name implies, this museum houses modern artworks from the 19th and 20th centuries, mainly from Italian artists, as well as works by others including Monet and Van Gogh.</p>
        <p>At the edge of the Villa Borghese park is the National Etruscan Museum of Villa Giulia, specializing in ancient pre-Roman artifacts from the Etruscan civilization of Italy.</p>
